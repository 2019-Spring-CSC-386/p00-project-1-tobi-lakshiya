## Purpose
*The purpose is to make sure that the person drinks enough water every day*

Most people don't drink enough water every day. setting a reminder on a phone is not too effective because you can just ignore it or lie about how much water you drank. We will solve this problem by creating an embedded system that checks the weight of the water bottle every few hours to make sure you have emptied the water bottle.

- Design: we will have a two liter bottle in the moring and it will measure the weight throughout the day

## Initial Design Plan

Outline the product :

- Images
  ![image of Schematics](images/Schematic.png) 
  ![image of BreadBoard](images/BreadBoard.png)
  
 Hardware Component 
  - weight sensor: It will be connected to the arduino through bread board and checks the weight of the water bottle. 
  - sound output device: This device will make sound or beep every few hours to let the user know to drink water. It will be connected to adruino through bread board.
  - arduino: It will house the code and will receive input from weight sensor and cause sound device to make noise.
  - bread board: It will be used to connect everything.
  - amplifire HX711 board: It will be used to amplify the changes in the electrical risistance from the weight sensor so it can be read by the arduino.

- List all of the known parts in the code you'll be creating.
  - we will have a function to measure the time during the day from 7am-7pm 
  - we will have a function  that rings a notification (alarm) every 4 hours and call another function to check the weight
  - we will have a function that takes the input from the wieght sensor and checks weight and output based on the mesurements. It will check if the current weight is less that the weight of the previous reading.

## Summary
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

Provide a brief summary description of the design and implementation,
including how much your initial design plan evolved, the final result
you achieved and the amount of time you spent as a programmer in
accomplishing these results, including any challenges overcome and
innovations that were not specifically required by the assignment.
This section should be no more than three paragraphs.

## Instructions
Explain how to use your product. 
This section should THOROUGHLY describe its usage (i.e., more than just "Push start").

## Errors and Constraints
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

Every program has bugs. Use this section to create a bullet list of
all known errors and deficiencies that remain in your product. 
Also, list any constraints that must exist for your product to work 
(e.g., Only works in low light situations).

## Reflection
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

Write 2 - 4 paragraphs on your reactions to the final project. 
Your reflection should be thoughtful and reflective. 
It is NOT a report about WHAT you did. 
Instead, it's a look back at what you learned by doing this project.
It should be critical of shortcomings (yours, as well as the instructors/assignments) 
as well as celebratory of what was achieved.

## Final Self-Evaluations
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project. 
Assign points to each team member in each category, based on their contribution to the team. 
The sum of all member's points in each category cannot exceed 10. 
For example, for Coding, Partner 1 could get 7 points, and Partner 2 gets 3 points. 
You can't give both people 6 points each though, as the sum exceeds 10.

**A Note from Scott to You**

While I expect this project to have issues, one
thing to keep in mind is HAVE FUN with it! Create a product that
expresses your personal interests. Break up the writing so itâ€™s not so burdensome.
We will have a live demo sessions at the end of the project to celebrate your accomplishments.
